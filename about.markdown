My name is Jaydin McMullan and I am a software developer from Dunedin, New Zealand.

I studied at the University of Otago and graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science, Majoring in Software Engineering and Computer Science.

I have been living in Oslo, Norway  for about 10 months at the time of creating this initial project as a start to my own personal projects.

This is going to be a start point to create an online portfolio.
